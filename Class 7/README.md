## Homewrok exercise 

1. Make javascript application that will take the data from the api: **https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users**,
and crate a table that will show the **name**, **email** and **phone** for every user in the API response. 

2. Implement the SEARCH input for every response property that is shown on the screen (name, email, phone) on the UI.

3. When the user will type some text in the input field, if the string match one of the response properties, the table should be filtered by that search criteria.

4. Make the search field to not be case sensitive.

5. **BONUS** - on every search, show the sum of the IDs of the elements that fulfill the search criteria in the console/ :) 

** Use higher order functions
